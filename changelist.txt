Changes
	- NPCs will now attack Pikmin!
		- Some NPC attacks may not work on Pikmin, so this feature can be quite buggy
		- This includes friendly NPCs (ie Resistance); this may be subject to change in the future
	- Pikmin can now be affected by triggers (ie trigger_hurt)
	- Purple and White Pikmin now separate upon dismiss, like the other three types
	- Purple and White Pikmin will now carry spoils to a random Onion (this may be subject to change in the future)
	- Killing an NPC now drops either nectar OR a 1 pellet, instead of just nectar
	- If Pikmin are ordered to charge at nectar, flower Pikmin will now ignore the command
	- Quite a few spawnlist changes:
		- The Louie Gun is now in the same Weapons category (Pikmin) as the Olimar Gun
		- Some entities in the spawnlist have been renamed (ie "Red Onion" is now "Onion (Red)") for ease of access 
		- Nectar is now included in the spawnlist
Fixes
	-Charging Pikmin will now properly latch onto NPCs
	-Optimization fixes; 50+ Pikmin should now be active at once without lagging horribly
		-However, leaf Pikmin now have piss-poor acceleration (which can't really be fixed, sorry)
