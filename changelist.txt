Additions
	- Added Candypop Buds! Use these to produce Purple/White Pikmin
Changes
	- Pikmin now make a sound when carrying stuff

	- Fixed Purple Pikmin moving horribly slow, even as flowers
	- Fixed Purple Pikmin throw distance; now you can actually THROW them
	- Fixed the Louie Gun not having the changed propeties of the Olimar Gun
