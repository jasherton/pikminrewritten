IMPORTANT NOTICE: Pikmin will "die" if sent to the Onion, but they are still safely stored inside it. This is purely a cosmetic bug which we cannot fix for now, but may be fixed in the future.

Additions
	- Something new is in the spawnmenu...
Changes
	- Pikmin now make a sound when carrying stuff
	- Pikmin won't respond to charge commands if they are busy carrying spoils
	- Idle or dismissed Pikmin won't try to carry anything
	- Sprouts react a LITTLE bit faster; the reaction time is part of previous optimization
Fixes
	- Fixed most NPC attacks not working on Pikmin
	- Fixed Pikmin being able to charge at each other (thanks to the hidden npc_bullseye attached to them)
	- Fixed leaf Pikmin moving too slow (for real, this time)
	- Fixed Purple Pikmin moving horribly slow, even as flowers
	- Fixed Purple Pikmin throw distance; now you can actually THROW them
	- Fixed the Louie Gun not having the changed propeties of the Olimar Gun
